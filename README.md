# cakeBuilder

CakeBuilder was designed after our introduction to Javascript course.

You are able to pick from a carousel of Bases, Icings and Toppings. With one of each selected, you can add your cake. Then a stripe purchase form becomes viewable.

Backend using Ruby on Rails and a front-end in vanilla javascript.

Further steps: fully integrating stripe payments, improving the UI.

Designed by Cristian and Paolo.
