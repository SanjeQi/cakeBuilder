# cakeBuilder

CakeBuilder was designed after our introduction to Javascript course.

You are able to pick a Base, Icing and Topping. With these three, you can add your cake which makes a stripe purchase form viewable.

Backend using Ruby on Rails and a front-end in vanilla javascript.

Further steps: fully integrating stripe payments, improving the UI.

Designed by Cristian and Paolo.
